# Sudoku Letters Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension modifies the New York Times Sudoku puzzle to display the letters A–I instead of the numbers 1–9. All game logic remains unchanged; only the frontend display is altered. This project was inspired by the creator's mom, who prefers letters over numbers when playing Sudoku.

## Purpose
Make Sudoku more accessible and fun for letter-lovers by mapping numbers to letters on the NYT Sudoku interface.
